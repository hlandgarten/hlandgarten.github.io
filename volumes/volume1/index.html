    <h2 id="volume-1-before-the-machines-19511968">Volume 1: Before the Machines (1951–1968)</h2>

<p>I was born on <strong>November 23, 1951</strong>, and grew up in a warm, tight-knit household in Flushing, Queens. From an early age, I experienced the closeness of family dinners, the daily visit from the milkman who left bottles in our front milk box, and the vegetable truck that rang its bell twice a week as it rolled down the street. It was a different era, where ingredients came to the doorstep. To get meat, you went to the butcher. For fish, to the fish store. Supermarkets hadn’t yet become widespread.</p>

<p>My parents loved to play games. My mother played Mahjong weekly with her friends, and my parents hosted poker games both at home and at others’ homes. But the most formative were the nightly games we played in the kitchen — Pinochle and Cribbage. Both games require calculation, memory, and strategy. These nightly sessions trained my mind early and helped shape my future approach to logic and problem-solving.</p>

<p>Our first television arrived shortly after — a huge wooden cabinet housing a small 13-inch black-and-white screen. I was captivated by westerns: <em>Hopalong Cassidy</em>, <em>The Rifleman</em>, and <em>The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp</em>. That obsession shaped my 4th birthday party, which included a toy gun belt with greenie stick-um caps, a six-shooter, and an air rifle that made a loud bang when cocked. I loved firing it inside the house — much to my mother’s annoyance. Six months later, it disappeared. I never had another birthday party as a child.</p>

<p>As a young child, I went through every common illness of the era — measles, mumps, chickenpox, German measles, and even jumbo hives — which eventually led to the removal of my tonsils when I was four. The one thing I still remember vividly is the metallic taste of the strainer they forced into my mouth during recovery.</p>

<p>My grandfather was a partner in a plumbing supply company called <strong>Sanitary Dash</strong>, and both my father and his identical twin brother Gerald worked there after returning from World War II. Our two families lived on opposite corners of the same block, and I regularly played with my cousins. Eventually, Sanitary Dash decided to move the company to Worcester, Massachusetts. My uncle moved with them, but my parents chose to stay in New York. That decision split our family in a permanent way.</p>

<p>As part of his exit agreement from Sanitary Dash, my father had to help the company set up its new Worcester factory — which meant traveling every weekend for months. His absence from home during this period had a noticeable impact on me as a child.</p>

<p>One of my earliest and most vivid sensory memories came when I was around <strong>six years old</strong>, when my family took me to a restaurant called the <strong>Golden Falcon</strong>. It was my first time eating in a real restaurant. I remember being dressed up, sitting at a table with linen napkins, and having waiters serve us. The sense of formality, the unique smells, and the taste of food I’d never had before — it left a lasting impression. That moment marked the beginning of my fascination with fine dining and a sense of occasion.</p>

<p>In 1958, my younger brother was born. To prepare us, my parents let my sister and me pick out presents that we would receive when he came home. I chose a satellite launcher; she chose a toy typewriter.</p>

<p>A few years later, when I was around <strong>10 to 12</strong>, my parents took me to <strong>Freedomland USA</strong>, a theme park in the Bronx that was essentially the East Coast’s answer to Disneyland. It brought all the cowboy shows I loved to life. I remember watching re-enactments of shootouts, seeing stagecoaches and horses, and immersing myself in the wild west fantasy world I’d only seen on television. For a child who adored <em>Hopalong Cassidy</em> and <em>The Rifleman</em>, it was a magical place.</p>

<p>Occasionally, my parents dropped my sister and me off at the movies while they ran errands. One such trip exposed me to <em>The 7th Voyage of Sinbad</em>, which terrified me. The cyclops and the dancing skeleton gave me nightmares for months. I couldn’t sleep without hanging my gun belt on the bedpost for protection.</p>

<p>Around 7 years old, I learned to ride a bicycle. My father held me upright, walked alongside me, and eventually let go. That first moment of balancing on my own became symbolic — it gave me independence.</p>

<p>When I was 7, I also began taking guitar lessons. I stayed with it for eight years and even performed <em>Malagueña</em> at a student concert. Later, I got a Guild electric guitar with an amplifier and tried starting a garage band in college. Though it never quite got off the ground, it connected me to music in a lasting way.</p>

<p>When I was 6 or 7, I joined the <strong>Cub Scouts</strong> and found great pride in earning merit badges. But one project — carving a race car from a block of wood — led to a painful lesson. I mistakenly cut toward myself and sliced my thumb open. That left a visable scar.</p>

<p>Like many boys of that era, I sometimes got into fights. One stands out. A boy named Jan, son of our Cub Scout leader, and I got into it. I won the first fight. A few weeks later, he retaliated — pushed me into a thorn bush and held me down for 15 minutes. That shook me. Afterward, I withdrew into books and spent an entire summer reading every one of the <strong>Dr. Doolittle</strong> novels — some as long as 900 pages.</p>

<p>I have little memory of school in Flushing. I attended <strong>PS164</strong> and I don’t remember any friends from school, but did have several good friends in the neighborhood. That changed when we moved to <strong>Douglaston</strong>, Queens, in 1961, and I started fifth grade at a new school. Around this time, I started building <strong>Heathkits</strong>: digital clocks, radios, and even a digital radio receiver. My parents also got me an electronics breadboarding system. I taught myself how to use transistors and integrated circuits and later learned how to <strong>program PROMs</strong> — long before flash memory existed, firmware updates meant reprogramming these chips by hand.</p>

<p>A few years later, when I was around <strong>10 to 12</strong>, my parents took me to <strong>Freedomland USA</strong>, a theme park in the Bronx that was essentially the East Coast’s answer to Disneyland. It brought all the cowboy shows I loved to life. I remember watching re-enactments of shootouts, seeing stagecoaches and horses, and immersing myself in the wild west fantasy world I’d only seen on television. For a child who adored <em>Hopalong Cassidy</em> and <em>The Rifleman</em>, it was a magical place.</p>

<p>By sixth grade, I was accepted into a <strong>two-year SP (Special Progress) program</strong>, allowing me to complete three years of schooling in two. The following year, I took the <strong>Iowa Test</strong>, a standardized assessment that oddly placed me in <strong>advanced English</strong> but not math, despite my deep love for math. This anomaly likely had to do with my habit of overanalyzing multiple-choice questions — something I later learned was a common trait among thoughtful students. Years later, I would study with <strong>Dr. Banesh Hoffmann</strong>, a collaborator of Einstein and critic of multiple-choice testing. He said students like me would get stuck trying to decide which of several flawed answers the test writer <em>intended</em> to be correct.</p>

<h3 id="a-brush-with-death-the-appendix-operation">A Brush with Death: The Appendix Operation</h3>

<p>One pivotal moment in my childhood that left a lasting impression occurred during junior high school. I had been trying to get out of going to Spanish class — not because I was sick, but because I truly hated the class and the teacher. That morning, I faked an illness and stayed home, thinking I could get away with it.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, our family doctor, Dr. Fleischman, was already scheduled to come by the house to see my sister. My father, suspecting that I was malingering, insisted that the doctor examine me as well. I still remember how annoyed I was as Dr. Fleischman started the exam. Then came the unexpected — when he did a rectal test, I jumped off the couch in pain. Dr. Fleischman immediately recognized the signs of appendicitis.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, he sent us straight to the hospital. I underwent emergency surgery that same day. The appendix had been close to rupturing. Had I not faked being sick, or had Dr. Fleischman not been there, things could have gone very differently. I spent two weeks in the hospital recovering, and another month recuperating at home.</p>

<p>Ironically, the Spanish teacher still held my absence against me. To make matters more ironic, that summer, my father hired a Spanish tutor, and I returned to school fluent. The teacher was stunned.</p>

<p>Looking back, it’s clear that a fib to avoid class might have saved my life — and taught me a lifelong lesson about intuition, luck, and the strange ways fate can unfold.</p>

<p>At age 12, my parents enrolled me in two weeks of <strong>golf lessons</strong>. I took to the game quickly and began practicing regularly. I improved fast. I read <strong>Jack Nicklaus’ books</strong>, studied the swings of <strong>Arnold Palmer</strong> and <strong>Gary Player</strong>, and watched every pro golf broadcast I could. One of my father’s friends took me to the <strong>Westchester Classic</strong> every year. I noticed that <strong>Nicklaus’ distance gave him an edge</strong> on long courses, while players like <strong>Al Geiberger</strong>, who wasn’t as long but extremely consistent, could <strong>win on tighter setups</strong> like the PGA. This helped me understand that <strong>different strategies succeed in different environments</strong> — a concept I would carry into other parts of my life.</p>

<p>But nothing had a deeper or more transformative effect than the <strong>1964–65 World’s Fair</strong>, which I attended multiple times between the ages of <strong>13 and 15</strong>. The <strong>GE Carousel of Progress</strong> wasn’t the only thing that captivated me. I was blown away by the <strong>AT&amp;T videophone</strong>, which felt like pure science fiction at the time. I marveled at the <strong>General Motors Futurama exhibit</strong>, which envisioned future cities, and I spent a lot of time at the <strong>IBM pavilion</strong>, where computers and technology were on full display. All of this prefigured what was to come on television with the debut of <em>Star Trek</em> and reinforced my love of shows like <em>Mission: Impossible</em>, <em>The Outer Limits</em>, <em>Twilight Zone</em>, and <em>Get Smart</em>. These experiences opened my mind to the possibilities of science and technology in a way that would influence my path for years to come.</p>

<p>In 11th and 12th grades, I was on the <strong>Bayside high school golf team</strong>. We played against other NYC schools on courses like <strong>Forest Park</strong>, a Bronx course named <strong>VAN CORTLANDT</strong>, and even traveled to <strong>LA TOURETTE</strong> on <strong>Staten Island</strong>. Competing on the team gave me confidence and sharpened my skills.</p>

<p>Another important thread from my high school years was my friendship with Alan Leifer. We were both passionate about mathematics, even though the school system didn’t recognize my aptitude due to flawed placement tests. Because I wasn’t allowed into advanced math classes, Alan and I began studying on our own. We explored advanced algebra and early calculus concepts together in our spare time — solving problems, working through textbooks, and pushing ourselves far beyond what was being taught in class. This was a powerful expression of inner directiveness — we weren’t doing it for grades or approval, just for the love of it.</p>

<p>It was also during that time that Alan and I discovered the world of James Bond. We became obsessed with the Ian Fleming books and read every one of them. When <em>Goldfinger</em> and later <em>Thunderball</em> were released in theaters, we traveled together into Manhattan to see them at the Forum Theater in Times Square. The combination of espionage, technology, and confidence that Bond exuded captivated us, and it added a new dimension to our adolescent worldview. This fascination would eventually feed into my later appreciation for spy fiction, strategy, and gadgets — all part of the intellectual and cultural backdrop that shaped my formative years.</p>

<h3 id="learning-to-drive">Learning to Drive</h3>

<p>As soon as I turned sixteen, I got my learner’s permit and began learning to drive. My parents took on the task of teaching me. My mother, in particular, believed in throwing me into the deep end. On one of my first lessons, she had me drive onto the Long Island Expressway so I could learn how to handle highway traffic and make lane changes at speed. I quickly became comfortable behind the wheel.</p>

<p>By the time spring semester of my final year in high school rolled around, I had already passed my road test, making me the only student in my Driver’s Ed class to have done so. That gave me a certain confidence and even a bit of status. My parents had already given me their old 1964 Bonneville, but under New York law, I still couldn’t drive alone until I turned 17 — even though I completed both Driver’s Ed and passed the road test.</p>

<p>So the car sat there waiting for me, a symbol of the independence I was about to gain. Once I turned 17, I could legally drive alone. That first solo drive — to Queens College and later to Knight House — marked the beginning of a new chapter.</p>
