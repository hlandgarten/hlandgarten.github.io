## My Beginning in Computers

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Before Lifeboat. Before Microsoft BASIC. Before the PC boom‚Ä¶**  
I was already building.

I had a **Teletype Model 33 ASR** for output and a **one-line LED terminal** for input. My storage? A **cassette tape**. I wrote a complete **pack list, invoice, and A/R posting system** in BASIC‚Äîon that hardware.

It was primitive, but it automated hours of work.

Then came the **Altair 8800**. When I ran Microsoft BASIC from **paper tape** and saw it greet me on that LED terminal, I knew the future had arrived.

> I wasn‚Äôt just watching the birth of personal computing.  
> I was helping raise it.

## The BabyBlue Breakthrough

In **1982**, I was president of **XEDEX**, creators of **BabyBlue**‚Äîa device that allowed the IBM PC to run **CP/M software**, bridging a crucial compatibility gap.

> ‚ÄúIt gives you all the advantages of the IBM hardware plus the ability to run the enormous base of CP/M software.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Harris Landgarten*, UPI interview, 1982

BabyBlue dramatically expanded the IBM PC‚Äôs software base and helped establish it as a universal platform.

## Leading Techland Systems

As **President of Techland Systems** (until 1985), I focused on **protocol conversion systems**‚Äîthe glue between incompatible computing systems.

Techland made it possible for minicomputers, PCs, and mainframes to **talk to each other**, laying groundwork for the interoperability that defines computing today.

See the [archived brochure on Bitsavers](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/datapro/protocol_conversion_systems/C23-825_Techland_Systems.pdf).

## Innovating in Noise Cancellation

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

By **1988**, I had shifted my focus to a new frontier: **sound**.

I joined **Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc. (NCTI)**, working alongside **John McCloy Jr.** to pioneer breakthroughs in **active noise and vibration control**. The idea was radical at the time‚Äîcanceling sound not with insulation, but with precision-engineered anti-sound.

üì∞ **Featured in The New York Times**  
> ‚ÄúYou Can't Stand the Noise? Get an Anti-Noise Machine‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *The New York Times*, March 2, 1988, Page D6  
> *(Subscription required)*

Earlier, science correspondent **William J. Broad** also covered our innovations:  
> ‚ÄúNew Technology Defeats Unwanted Noise‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *The New York Times*, June 30, 1987  
> *(Subscription required)*

üõ†Ô∏è Our work targeted **real-world acoustic problems**‚Äîfactories, fans, engines, and vibration systems.

üí° **Wider recognition included**:
- A feature in *The Economist*
- A **live demo on Good Morning America**, where I canceled vibrations in a **pool of water**
- An interview on *Innovation TV* about the future of acoustic control

This early work helped lay the foundation for technologies that would become standard in **headphones**, **cars**, and **industrial noise solutions**.

## Before the Machines

<details>

üé∏ I was at **Woodstock**, surrounded by mud, music, and revolution. That moment shaped my values and vision.

üìö I studied under **Dr. Hoffman** at **Queens College**, who sparked my early interest in systems thinking and philosophy‚Äîcore ideas that would shape my engineering and leadership for decades.

From cassette tapes to AI forecasts, this is the story of someone who‚Äôs always been **ahead of the curve**.
