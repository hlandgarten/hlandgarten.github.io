<summary><strong>Before the Machines (1951–1968)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- I was born on **November 23, 1951**.
- I was placed into the **two-year SP (Special Progress) program**, which skipped **8th grade**, so I entered high school much younger than my peers.
- When I was around **5 years old**, my **Uncle Gerald** and his family lived on the **opposite corner of our block** in Brooklyn — we were very close, and I played with my cousins constantly.
- When the family business **Sanitary Dash** decided to move to **Worcester, Massachusetts**, they relocated — which was **upsetting to me as a child** and marked a turning point in our family dynamics.

### Mechanical Curiosity and Early Lessons

- My **grandfather** (who passed away around the time I was born) had been a partner in **Sanitary Dash**.
- My **father** and **his twin brother** worked there until the move, but my father stayed in **Brooklyn** and started his own company: **Ace Brass Manufacturing**.
- Ace Brass was a **small factory** with **cutting machines**, **punch presses**, **threading machines**, and **saw sharpeners**.

- One early story that shaped me: after we moved to **Douglaston** at age 12, my parents gave me a **chemistry set**.
  - I set it up in the basement and performed an experiment to make **purple dye**.
  - Not knowing my mother was soaking **good linens** in the basement sink, I poured the dye down the drain — and turned all her linens purple.
  - My chemistry set **disappeared shortly afterward**, and I developed a **lifelong distaste for chemistry**.
  - This pushed me toward **electronics, music, and computing** instead.

### Golf, Confidence, and Independence

- After moving to Douglaston, my parents enrolled me in **golf lessons** with the pro at the **Douglaston Golf Course**, which was just across the street.
- I **immediately took to golf** — for the first time, I could **beat the athletes at school** in something they cared about.
- This gave me confidence I had never experienced before.
- I even **won a junior tournament** at the course by shooting a **67 or 68**.

- In the summers, I stopped going to the beach with my mother and instead played **golf every day**.
  - I had a **city golf pass** that let me play for **75 cents a round**.

- I also learned an important early lesson: **never give advice on the golf course unless asked**.
  - Trying to help others with their swing led to **hostile reactions**, which taught me about **boundaries and communication**.

### Early Philosophical Insight

- Around age 15 or 16, I had a **revelation** — either from a dream or subconscious insight:
  > **Everything in life is cyclical.** Everything has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Some things end quickly, others last longer.
- This insight gave me a deep **adaptability** and ability to **accept when things end**.
- You can see this in my ability to **pivot quickly** after being fired from Xedex — I started Techland the next day.

### Growing Rebellion and Shyness

- I had always been independent, but my **rebellious streak didn’t emerge** until I started college.
- Before that, I was **shy, quiet, and deeply repressed**.
  - **Golf**, **bowling**, and **archery** all helped draw me out — I even **won an archery trophy** at summer camp at age 14.
- A few years later, I could confidently **fly to Detroit** to present a **PC strategy to Ford** in the Renaissance Center.

### Attending Woodstock (1969)

- In **August 1969**, I attended **Woodstock** with friends.
- We made it off **Route 17 quickly**, but the **final few miles took 8 hours**.
- Stuck on a **one-lane country road**, our **1964 blue Pontiac Bonneville** overheated.
- We were stranded at an intersection when a **troop of Boy Scouts** passed by.
  - Two scouts were carrying an **enormous water container** slung on a pole.
  - I asked them to help us **refill the radiator**, which they gladly did to lighten their load.
  - We restarted the car — and realized we were **just one block from the parking area**.
- It was **Tuesday**, days before the music even started — a **surreal and iconic moment**.

<summary><strong>College and the Draft (1968–1975)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- I began college in the **fall of 1968**, just before turning 17.
- I enrolled at **Queens College** as a **Computer Science major**, eager to leave behind high school boredom and dive into meaningful learning.
- Back then, **all programming was done using punch cards**, submitted to a **Xerox mainframe** — it could take a **week** to get your results, only to discover a syntax error.
- Frustrated by poor instruction and glacial turnaround time, I dropped the CS major, though not my passion for computing.

- The **Vietnam War draft** loomed over everything at that time.
  - I registered for the draft on my **18th birthday** in **1969**.
  - I purposely **slowed my academic progress**, registering for only **12 credits per term** to stretch out my **college deferment**.
- When Queens College dropped its **core curriculum**, I focused entirely on subjects that interested me: **physics**, **math**, and **business law**.

- I became active in my **house plan** and made lasting friendships.
- I also joined the **college golf team**, where I met **Danny Rosenthal**, who would later become **CFO of Techland Systems**.
- I bowled competitively on **five-man bowling teams**, participating in **Kegler tournaments** nearly every weekend.
  - I still have many **trophies**, including one for a **278 game** — **11 strikes in a row** followed by **8 pins**, just shy of a perfect 300.

- In **1972**, my father became seriously ill.
  - I took a **leave of absence** from college to **run Ace Brass Manufacturing**, the family’s small plumbing supply factory in Brooklyn.
- In **August 1969**, I experienced a defining cultural moment: **attending Woodstock**.
  - It took us **eight hours to go just a few miles**.
  - Our car overheated near the top of a hill and got stuck at a crossroads.
  - Suddenly, a **troop of Boy Scouts** passed by carrying a large container of **water on a pole**.
  - I asked if they could help refill our radiator — they were happy to lighten their load, and we got the water we needed.
  - We restarted the car and, as it turned out, we were **only one block from where we had to park**.
  - It was an unforgettable experience and part of a legendary moment in American counterculture.
  - There, I learned to operate **cutting machines**, **punch presses**, **threading machines**, and **saw sharpeners**.
- After about a year, I returned to college with renewed discipline.
  - I switched to a **math major**, where I had already accumulated the most credits.
  - I took **18 credits per term** and **summer classes**, accelerating my path to graduation.
  - My **draft lottery number** was high enough that the risk of conscription was gone by then.

- I graduated in **December 1975**.
- In that same month, I met **JoAnn**, who would later become my wife.
- We were married on **May 6, 1978**.

<summary><strong>My Beginning in Computers (1975–1980)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- After graduating from Queens College in **December 1975**, I went to work **full-time at Ace Brass**, my father's small manufacturing business in Brooklyn.
- I had already moved out of my parents' house in **1974** into an apartment, and after JoAnn and I met, she eventually moved in with me.
- During those years, I taught myself how to program using early microcomputers.

- I bought an **IMSAI Z-80 system** and used it to write a full **invoicing, packing list, and accounts receivable system** for the business.
  - All of it was written in **Microsoft BASIC**.
  - Storage was via **cassette tape** — floppy drives were not yet available to me.
- I discovered and began purchasing software from **Lifeboat Associates**, which at that time was one of the key distributors of CP/M software.

- My interest in personal computing had started even earlier:
  - I ordered an **Altair 8800** in kit form immediately after seeing it in *Popular Electronics*.
  - I built it myself — initially with only **256 bytes of RAM** and blinking LEDs on the front panel.
  - Later, I upgraded to **4K of RAM** and obtained **Microsoft BASIC on paper tape**.
  - I used a **Teletype Model 33 ASR** as input/output.

- That Altair was a turning point: it was the first time I could write code and see results **instantly**.
  - After the delays of punch card programming, this was revolutionary.

- These years were when my passion for computing came alive — not academically, but in the **real world**, solving real business problems.

<summary><strong>Working at Lifeboat Associates (1980–1981)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- In **1979**, I got a call from **Tony Gold**, president of Lifeboat Associates, offering me a job.
- In **1980**, I left Ace Brass and joined **Lifeboat Associates**, a major distributor of microcomputer software.
- I edited and published our customer newsletter, **Lifelines**, where I wrote weekly editorials about the evolving tech landscape.

- I had a policy of documenting **software bugs**, even in major compilers — including Microsoft BASIC.
  - This got the attention (and ire) of **Bill Gates**, who called me directly more than once to complain.

- I negotiated **royalty contracts** with a number of developers and helped broaden Lifeboat’s catalog.
- Lifeboat worked with:
  - **Micro Focus** for COBOL
  - **Peter Rozen** for TMaker
  - **Balcones Software** in Austin for advanced accounting
- I frequently traveled to Austin to coordinate with Balcones.

- Lifeboat also worked with **Ford Motor Company** on their early PC adoption strategy.
  - I presented at the **Renaissance Center** in Detroit.

- After an Intel conference in Oregon, I joined **Neil Colvin** for a visit to Microsoft, where **Bill Gates** gave us a personal tour of their new campus in **Redmond** — they had only leased **half the building** at that point.

- Bill and I discussed his obsession with **software piracy** and his strategy of **OEM bundling** — getting software pre-installed on new computers.
  - That approach helped win deals with **Tandy** and others, but ironically, laid the foundation for Microsoft’s later **antitrust troubles**.

- One of the most important relationships formed during this time was with **Neil Colvin** of Phoenix Technologies.
  - Through Neil, I also worked with **Mike Aaronson** and tested an early product called **P-Mate**.
  - I suggested to Neil and Mike that the industry badly needed a **third-party BIOS**.
  - That idea would eventually help spark the **IBM PC clone revolution**.

> I didn’t get a commission — but I helped launch an industry.

<summary><strong>Xedex & BabyBlue (1981–1982)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- In **1981**, I was approached by **Mike Aaronson**.
  - His son needed a serious operation, and he was seeking a way to raise **$10,000** by licensing a product he had developed.
  - That product was a **Z80-based co-processor board** that, when installed in the IBM PC, allowed it to run **CP/M software** — which dramatically increased the available software base for the new IBM machine.

- I put together the deal and left Lifeboat with:
  - **Roland Joffe** (head of marketing),
  - **Rebecka** (his assistant), and
  - **Bob Hassel** (engineer and BIOS programmer).

- Together, we launched a new company: **Xedex**.
  - We headquartered it in a **house on 6th Avenue in Burlington, Vermont**.
  - Bob Hassel opened a **development office in Suffern, NY** to build the boards.

- Within **five months**, we were shipping product and generating buzz.
  - We called it **BabyBlue**.
  - The press coverage was incredible, thanks in part to our PR firm, **Burson-Marsteller**, which **Roland Joffe** had hired.

- 📰 In February 1982, UPI reported:
  > “XEDEX President Harris Landgarten said Baby Blue ‘will make the IBM machine more versatile than an Apple or a Tandy microcomputer in terms …’” — UPI Archives

- BabyBlue let the IBM PC run thousands of legacy CP/M applications — an enormous boost during the PC’s first wave of adoption.

- Sadly, in **late 1982**, I discovered that **Bob Hassel** was sabotaging the hardware and had made a side deal with our investor to take over the company.
  - I was notified that I was **fired**.
  - I immediately took my entire team and went on to form a new company: **Techland Systems Inc.**

> I wasn’t upset — I had already realized that BabyBlue had a **short shelf life**.
> The future was in connectivity and networking — and I pivoted toward it quickly.

<summary><strong>Leading Techland Systems (1982–1985)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- After leaving Xedex in **late 1982**, I founded **Techland Systems Inc.**
- I was joined by my former team and hired **Richard Clowes**, a top ex-IBM salesman, as **VP of Sales**.
- Our first product was a protocol conversion system that allowed PCs to connect with **minicomputers and mainframes**, bridging previously incompatible systems.
  - This became the foundation for **BlueLynx**, our flagship connectivity solution.

- We quickly gained traction:
  - **RJR Reynolds**,
  - **New England Life**, and
  - the **Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco** were among our **first clients**.
  - Richard brought in **$2 million in sales in the first year**.

- We grew rapidly to **50 employees** and opened offices at **Waterside Plaza** on the East River in New York.

- We also opened a **Techland Systems subsidiary in London**, run by Richard Clowes’ brother.
  - Richard and I flew over on the **Concorde** a few times a year.
  - We also flew to **Singapore**, where we arranged **cheaper manufacturing** for hardware components in Malaysia.
  - One trip included stops in **China**, **Singapore**, **Bombay**, and **London**, all first-class — the entire itinerary cost **$1,500** per person thanks to strong exchange rates.

- During this period, we hired **Eldon Ziegler** on the recommendation of Neil Colvin.
  - Eldon was a brilliant software developer.
  - He built our first **personal information manager**, and we maintained a **lifetime friendship**.

> BlueLynx could have become part of Xedex if I had been treated honestly — instead, it became the core of Techland.
> Ultimately, Techland earned me **$3.3 million**.

<summary><strong>Innovating in Noise Cancellation (1985–1990)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- In **1985**, **Bob Benningson** of **York Research** approached us with an offer to acquire **Techland Systems**.
- After nearly a year of negotiation, we **merged with York**, and Techland became part of a **public company**.

- Just one month later, I discovered the new management had **stopped paying payroll taxes** to save cash.
  - My lawyers advised me to **resign immediately**, which I did.
- York later **sued me and other shareholders** to return our stock.
  - We were in litigation until **1990**.
  - In the summer of 1990, I **settled** with York and sold my stock for **$3.3 million**.
  - The other shareholders persisted and ultimately **won their case in 1991**.

---

- After I left York, I was contacted by **Mike Parella**, who invited me to help **restructure Noise Cancellation Technologies (NCTI)**, a public company based in **Miami**.
- Their goal was to secure patent rights for advanced **noise cancellation algorithms**.

- I flew to **Essex, England** to meet with **Professor Chaplin** at the **University of Essex**.
  - The university was skeptical due to prior mismanagement, but I smoothed things over and secured the **Chapin patent rights** for **£100,000**.

- I then called **Eldon Ziegler** and sent him to **Miami** to evaluate what NCTI had.
  - His verdict: **fire everyone** and start over.
  - I hired Eldon as **VP of Engineering**, and he opened a **lab in Columbia, Maryland**.
  - Meanwhile, I opened an office in **Great Neck, New York** and hired a full team.
- My weekly routine involved **commuting to Columbia, Maryland** to visit Eldon and the lab.
  - I flew to **BWI** or took **Amtrak** — usually staying for a couple of days each week.
  - **JoAnn** would often **drive me to the airport** and **pick me up** when I returned.

- A few months later, I was joined by **John J. McCloy Jr.**, son of the most influential private citizen of the 20th century — John J. McCloy Sr., who negotiated the settlement of the **Cuban Missile Crisis**.
  - I met McCloy Sr. in **Greenwich** when he was **92 years old**.

- John Jr. introduced me to senior figures in **government and defense**.
  - We sold systems to the **military**.
  - On a trip to **Berlin**, I had **house seats** for **Herbert von Karajan’s final concert**, conducting Beethoven’s 9th.
  - I also walked through **East Berlin** during that visit — a surreal and eerie experience.

- In **1989**, I flew to **Seattle** to help close a deal with **Boeing**.
  - The flight was delayed from 9 PM to **3 AM**, and I arrived on very little sleep.
  - I still closed the deal — a testament to resilience.

- I stopped working actively for NCTI shortly after I sold my York stock in **1990**.

<summary><strong>Next Chapter: 1990s–2000</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- In **late 1990**, I got my first real **internet connection** using **PPP over a modem**, through **Pipeline.com**, which later became **MindSpring**.
- I began exploring the web using early browsers like **Netscape** and quickly became proficient.

- Around the same time, after settling the York lawsuit, I began exploring **financial markets**.
  - I took courses at the **New York Institute of Finance** with **Ralph Acampora**.
  - I started using software from **AIQ Systems**, a company I had helped during the Lifeboat era.

- At an AIQ seminar in **Miami**, I became interested in applying their tools to **futures markets**.
  - Back home, I used **TradeStation 1.0**, connected to a **signal data feed** using a crude FM antenna.

- I developed my **first S&P futures trading system** — and it worked.
  - The challenge was execution: there was no way to send trades quickly to the pit.
  - I asked **Eldon Ziegler** and my broker to help.
  - Eldon built software that transmitted trades via **high-speed modem** to my broker’s office, where they were then phoned into the pit.
  - This was functionally one of the **first trading bots**.

- As our success grew, I upgraded to a **satellite data feed**.
  - I remember one day playing golf at my country club when my broker called mid-round: we were up **$150,000** on the day.
  - I let it run — and by day’s end we had made **$340,000**.

- Eventually, the advantage of this system faded.
  - But in **2000**, the first **electronically traded futures contract (the ES)** was introduced.
  - At the time it was only accessible via special terminals, while most S&P futures were still traded in the **Chicago pit**.

---

### Personal Loss and Growth

- In **November 1991**, we bought our new house in **Old Brookville, Long Island** and moved in by early 1992.
- Sadly, my **father passed away in 1994**, and my **mother followed six months later**.
- In **1996**, **JoAnn’s mother** also passed away.

---

### Las Vegas & Casino Strategy

- Starting in the **late 1980s**, I began attending **COMDEX** and **CES** in **Las Vegas**.
- I learned the importance of building relationships with **Casino Hosts (CNOs)** to secure meeting space, limos, and reservations.

- In **1988**, during my time with NCTI, I was in Vegas with a business contact.
  - I had tickets to the **Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Marvin Hagler** fight.
  - JoAnn gave up her ticket so I could take the client — it became a historic night.

- Through the 1990s, I:
  - Played elite golf courses like **Shadow Creek**, often in pro-ams with top players
  - Attended every major **championship boxing match**
  - Attended **3–4 Super Bowls**, including one in **Miami** followed by a stay at **Mar-a-Lago**
  - Was invited to the **opening of the Bellagio**, flown out on a **private plane**, checked in from the runway, and attended a concert by **Van Cliburn**
  - Attended the MGM’s new **Studio 54 opening**, where **Elton John** played piano for hours while I mingled with **Tony Curtis**

- I also played Shadow Creek over **140 times**, including an entire month of daily rounds with **Kenny Green** as he prepped to return to the pro tour.

- These invitations stemmed from cultivating strong **casino relationships**, which often led to insider access, luxury travel, and once-in-a-lifetime moments.

- One unforgettable night: the infamous **“Bite Fight”** between **Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield**.
  - JoAnn and I were about 15 rows back.
  - After the ear bite, chaos erupted — chairs flew in the balconies.
  - **Donald Trump** quickly exited with his then-wife.
  - JoAnn retrieved our dinner photos while I played craps — and a man at the table went on a huge roll.
  - Suddenly, a pit boss shouted: "**Someone has a gun!**"
  - Everyone dove for cover. JoAnn hid behind a slot machine.
  - We later learned high-stakes blackjack tables were overturned, and chips were stolen.
  - The **entire Las Vegas Strip was shut down**, but the riot never made national news — a testament to Vegas’ media influence.

<summary><strong>Expanding in the 2000s (2000–2004)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- At **CES 2001**, I encountered the original **TiVo** for the first time.
  - It completely changed my thinking about the **future of media technology**.
  - I immediately realized that **a lifetime of analog tape recording and tape hiss** was coming to an end.
  - This was the dawn of **digital recording to hard drives** — and I saw its implications not only for entertainment, but also for **security systems**.

- I contacted executives at **TiVo** to explore ways they could support the **security industry** by helping record **video surveillance** directly to disk.
- This insight led me to **jump at the opportunity** to take over **Samsung CCTV** in Dallas.
  - CCTV held **exclusive American distribution rights** for **Samsung security products**.
  - This positioned me at the forefront of **digital video recording** in security and helped build my relationship with **Samsung** as a technology partner.
- I decided to invest **$50,000** of my own money into **Samsung CCTV**, and my **father-in-law invested $25,000** as well.


- As **electronic trading** matured in the early 2000s, I continued to monitor markets and technology but began exploring new opportunities.

- I invested more time into understanding **market microstructure**, **high-frequency signals**, and **execution dynamics**.
  - My experience in software and systems thinking led me to anticipate many of the shifts that would become standard in modern algorithmic trading.

- I also remained involved in **audio technology**, **PC performance**, and began following the emerging field of **machine learning**, although I wouldn't engage deeply in building AI models until much later.

- This was a quieter period in terms of new businesses, but one of **deep preparation** — sharpening my skills and maintaining strong industry relationships.

- It set the stage for my eventual pivot toward **AI-based market modeling** and system design, which would begin in earnest in **2016**.
- During this period, I also became deeply involved in testing **GlusterFS**, a distributed file system.
  - Thanks to my **early beta access to AWS**, I was able to **fully test GlusterFS on AWS infrastructure**, pushing its limits in a scalable environment.
- In **2002**, I met with **Samsung** at a major **security industry trade show in Las Vegas**.
  - Later that year, we hosted **Samsung executives** at a high-level meeting at the **Four Seasons Hotel in Dallas**.
  - I vividly remember playing golf with them in **39° weather** — we only lasted **nine holes** before heading back inside.

- We wanted Samsung to partner with us on **Eldon Ziegler’s invention**: a system for controlling **commercial thermostats**.
  - They **jumped at the idea**.
  - I was in charge of embedding **Linux** onto their hardware device.
  - I worked directly with **Samsung engineers in Korea**, exchanging messages via **AOL Instant Messenger every night**.
  - I recorded and distributed these technical discussions to our team daily.

- I had to **teach the Samsung team what a bootloader was**.
  - At the time, standard practice was to put the **bootloader in flash** and everything else in **RAM**.
  - I proposed a better approach: using **experimental flash file systems** to store **everything** — OS, bootloader, and Eldon’s application — in **flash memory**, using **RAM only for data**.
  - The system worked beautifully.
  - One critical task was **modifying the existing RS-232 serial driver** to support our specific hardware needs.
