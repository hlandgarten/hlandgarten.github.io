<summary><strong>My Beginning in Computers</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

* At **16**, I started college as a **Computer Science major** at **Queens College**.

* The school had only a **Xerox-built mainframe**, and all programming was in **Fortran** via **punch cards**.

* You’d type each line onto a punch card, submit a stack, and wait **a week** for results—often discovering only a syntax error.

* Frustrated by this process and poor instruction, I left the major—but not my passion for computing.

* Built advanced **Heathkits**, ending with a **digital FM receiver**.

* Ordered one of the first **HP-85** calculators—waited **three months** for delivery.

* Used it in place of a slide rule during physics courses.

### Enter the Altair

* Bought an **audio sweep generator kit** from **MITS** in 1973 to align tape heads on my **TEAC** reel-to-reel.
* MITS sent me a **\$100 discount certificate** in 1974.
* When the **Altair 8800** was introduced in *Popular Electronics*, I ordered one immediately—in kit form.
* Built it myself: it had just **256 bytes of memory** and blinking LEDs.

### BASIC Changed Everything

* Upgraded to **4 KB of RAM** and received **Microsoft BASIC on paper tape**.
* For the first time, I could **write code and get instant results**.
* This was a revelation after the week-long delays in college labs.

### Building Real Software

* Bought an **IMSAI Z-80 system** and wrote a full **invoicing, packing list, and A/R system** in BASIC for my father’s business.
* Stored everything on **cassette tape**—no floppy disks yet.
* Ran **CP/M**, and bought software from **Lifeboat Associates**.

> That Altair wasn’t just my first PC.
> It was the gateway to a career in tech.

<summary><strong>Working at Lifeboat Associates</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

* In **1979**, **Tony Gold** (President of Lifeboat) called and offered me a job.
* In **1980**, I left my family’s plumbing supply business and joined **Lifeboat Associates**.

### Key Contributions:

* Edited and published **Lifelines**, our customer newsletter.

  * I openly documented **bugs in major software** — sparking strong reactions, including from **Bill Gates**.
* Negotiated **royalty contracts** with prominent developers.

### Industry Collaboration:

* **Micro Focus** – COBOL compilers
* **Peter Rozen** – TMaker
* **Balcones Software** (Austin, TX) – advanced accounting

  * Traveled there frequently

### Ford & Microsoft

* Helped **Ford Motor Company** develop its **early PC strategy**.

  * Presented at the **Renaissance Center** in Detroit.
* After an Intel conference in Oregon, **Bill Gates** gave **Neil Colvin** and me a personal tour of **Microsoft’s first Redmond campus**.

  * They had only leased **half** the building at the time!

### Behind the Scenes with Bill Gates

* Discussed his mission to stop **software piracy**.

  * His idea: **OEM bundling** — software pre-installed on computers.
* This approach led to deals with **Tandy**, among others.
* Ironically, it also laid the foundation for Microsoft’s **antitrust troubles**.

### BIOS Opportunity

* Had a close partnership with **Neil Colvin** (Phoenix Technologies).
* Tested **P-Mate** for **Mike Aaronson**, Neil’s friend.
* I was the one who suggested the market need for **third-party BIOS**—vital to launching the **IBM PC clone industry**.

> I didn’t get a commission—but I helped launch an industry.

<summary><strong>Xedex & BabyBlue</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

* In **1981**, I was approached by **Mike Aaronson**. His son needed an important operation, and he asked me to help structure a deal through which he could receive **\$10,000** for his invention.
* In exchange, he offered rights to a **Z80-based coprocessor** he had developed that, when installed in an **IBM PC**, allowed it to run **CP/M programs** not available for the 8086.
* I put together a deal and left **Lifeboat** with **Roland Joffe** (head of marketing), his assistant **Rebecka**, and **Bob Hassel** (engineer and BIOS programmer).
* Together we founded **Xedex** to build and market the coprocessor, which we named **BabyBlue**.
* Roland Joffe founded our main office in a Burlington house on **6th Avenue**, and also hired **Burson-Marsteller** as our public relations agency. Meanwhile, Bob opened an office in **Suffern, NY** to manufacture the boards.
* Within five months, we were shipping — and BabyBlue quickly earned **tremendous press and notoriety**.
* I wasn’t upset about leaving, though — I knew from the start that BabyBlue’s software and hardware had a **limited lifespan**.
* Ironically, the investor who sided with Hassel was left with a product that had little future — while I was free to build something more enduring at Techland.
* It's important to note that the later **BabyBlue II** version was developed **after I left Xedex**. My direct involvement was with the original BabyBlue and the formation and early success of the company.

<summary><strong>Leading Techland Systems</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

* In **late 1982**, I discovered that **Bob Hassel** had been sabotaging our hardware at Xedex.
* He had made a deal with the investor to take over the company.
* I was informed that I was **fired**, and in response, I took my entire team and launched a new company: **Techland Systems Inc.**
* As part of building Techland, we brought in **Richard Clowes**, a former top IBM salesperson, as **VP of Sales**.
* Understanding our situation, **Neil Colvin** and **Mike Aaronson** connected me with **Reed Smith** and his friend **Bob**, who had developed **3270 emulation software** that would evolve into **BlueLynx**.
* Had I been dealt with honestly, BlueLynx would likely have become part of Xedex’s product line.
* Ultimately, Techland proved to be a far better outcome — it eventually earned me **\$3.3 million**, though that part of the story comes later.

### Product Spotlight: BlueLynx & TwinX

* Techland’s **BlueLynx** product line offered full **3270/5250 terminal emulation** for IBM mainframe connectivity, supporting **SNA/SDLC** networks.

* A 1984 **DataPro industry report** named BlueLynx a standout in protocol conversion systems. ([Bitsavers report](https://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/datapro/protocol_conversion_systems/C23-825_Techland_Systems.pdf))

* BlueLynx made the PC appear to the host as a **5251 Model 12** terminal and could interface with **5256 dot-matrix printers**.

* We also developed **TwinX**, a solution for local Twinax connectivity to **IBM System/34 and System/36** minicomputers.

* In the first year alone, **Richard brought in \$2 million in sales**, landing major clients like **RJR Reynolds**, **New England Life**, and the **Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco**.

* Soon, we had **50 employees** and offices at **Waterside Plaza** on the East River in New York.

* We launched a **Techland subsidiary in London**, run by **Richard Clowes' brother**. Richard and I would fly over on the **Concorde** a couple of times a year.

* We also flew to **Singapore**, where we arranged lower-cost manufacturing for BlueLynx hardware in **Malaysia**.

> At the time, the dollar was at an all-time high.
> We booked a round-the-world trip: Concorde to London, first-class Singapore Airlines to China, stops in the New Territories, return via Bombay.
> Total cost: **\$1,500 per person.**

* While at Techland, I also wanted to create a personal information management software product.

* I asked **Neil Colvin** for a recommendation. He said the best application developer he knew was **Eldon Ziegler**.

* We hired Eldon, who delivered excellent software and became a lifelong collaborator and friend.

* In **1985**, **Bob Benningson** of **York Research** expressed interest in acquiring Techland.

* After a year of negotiations, we sold the company to York — and became a **public company**.

* Within a month of the merger, I discovered the new owners had **stopped paying payroll taxes** to conserve cash.

* My lawyers advised me to **resign immediately**.

* After I left, **York Research sued** us to recover the stock.

* The litigation lasted until **1990**, when **Bob Benningson settled with me**.

* I sold my **York stock for \$3.3 million**.

* Other stockholders persisted and eventually **won the case in 1991**.

<summary><strong>Innovating in Noise Cancellation</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

* After leaving Techland, I was contacted by **Mike Parella** to help reconstitute **Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc. (NCTI)**, a public company in **Miami**.

* One of my first tasks was flying to **Essex**, England to meet **Professor Chaplin** at the **University of Essex**.

  * Our goal was to secure his **PAC patents** for systematic noise control using **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.
  * I smoothed things over with the university and closed the deal, paying **£100,000** for the rights.

* When I returned, I sent **Eldon Ziegler** to Miami to evaluate NCTI’s technical base.

  * His report was blunt: fire everyone and liquidate the assets — nothing was salvageable.

* I hired Eldon as **VP of Engineering**, and he opened a new **lab in Columbia, Maryland**.

* I also established an executive office in **Great Neck, NY**, hiring a dozen staff to restart the company.

* A few months later, **John McCloy Jr.** joined us.

  * John was the son of **John J. McCloy**, former U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, and considered one of the most influential private citizens of the 20th century.
  * His father played a critical role in resolving the **Cuban Missile Crisis**.
  * I visited his father in **Greenwich** when he was 92 — a truly memorable conversation.

* John introduced me to many contacts, including the **Secretary of Defense**, whom we met at the **Pentagon**.

  * NCTI sold systems to the **U.S. military**.

* I also traveled with John to **Berlin** and **Munich**.

  * In Berlin, he was treated like royalty due to his father's legacy.
  * I had **house seats** for **Herbert von Karajan’s** final concert conducting **Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony**.
  * I also crossed into **East Berlin** with one of John’s friends — an eerie, unforgettable experience.

* In **1989**, I flew to **Seattle** to help close a deal with **Boeing**.

  * My flight, originally scheduled for 9 PM, was delayed until **3 AM**.
  * I flew in the middle seat of a row of five, flanked by **two nuns on each side**.
  * Despite no sleep, I delivered — and **closed the deal**.

* In the **summer of 1990**, after selling my York Research stock,
  I **stepped away from active involvement** with NCTI.

<summary><strong>Before the Machines</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

* Attended **Woodstock**

  * Music, mud, movement — and a mindset that stayed with me
* Studied under **Dr. Banesh Hoffmann** at **Queens College**

  * A renowned physicist and mathematician who co-authored *Relativity: The Special and the General Theory* with **Albert Einstein**.
  * Dr. Hoffmann had been one of Einstein’s closest collaborators and defenders of general relativity.
  * He became a mentor and advocate for me during my time at Queens.
  * He wrote me a heartfelt and deeply intellectual **letter of recommendation**, in which he said I was the best student he had had in his 30 years of teaching and that he expected big things from me. I've kept the letter to this day as a cherished memento of his confidence and guidance.
  * Deep influence on systems thinking and philosophy
