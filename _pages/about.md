<summary><strong>My Beginning in Computers</strong></summary>

### ✅ Before Lifeboat. Before Microsoft BASIC. Before the PC boom…

I was already building.

- I had:
  - A **Teletype Model 33 ASR** for output
  - A **one-line LED terminal** for input
  - A **cassette tape** for storage
- I wrote a complete **pack list, invoice, and A/R posting system** in BASIC—on that hardware
- Then came the **Altair 8800**, and **paper tape**
- I ran Microsoft BASIC and watched it display its name—on that same LED terminal

> *I wasn’t just watching the birth of personal computing.  
> I was helping raise it.*

- It served as a bridge between old and new:
  - IBM’s hardware + CP/M’s software library

> “It gives you all the advantages of the IBM hardware plus the ability to run the enormous base of CP/M software.”  
> — *Harris Landgarten*, UPI, 1982
