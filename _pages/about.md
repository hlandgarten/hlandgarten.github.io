<summary><strong>Before the Machines (1951–1968)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- I was born on **November 23, 1951**.
- In **1955**, before my uncle moved to Worcester, **Uncle Gerald** lived with his family on the **opposite corner of our block**.
  - We had one corner; they had the other. I used to **play with my cousins** all the time.
  - When they moved to **Worcester**, it was **a little upsetting to me** as a child — it changed the dynamic of our close-knit family life.
- For reasons never fully explained to me, I qualified for a **two-year SP program** in junior high school.
  - As a result, I attended only **7th and 9th grade**, skipping **8th grade entirely**.
- Combined with my **late-year birthday**, this meant I was **younger than nearly everyone** at my educational level — which is how I ended up starting **college at age 16**.

- Moved from **Flushing** to **Douglaston**. Before then, I had been quite **shy and repressed**, not one to speak up or seek the spotlight.
- That started to change after the move. Around that time, my parents bought me a **chemistry set**, which I enthusiastically set up in the **basement** of our new home.
- I began conducting experiments, and by the third or fourth one, I learned how to make **purple dye**.
- When the experiment succeeded, I excitedly dumped the dye into the basement sink — not realizing my **mother was soaking her best linens** in that very sink.
- The linens all turned purple. My chemistry set **disappeared shortly thereafter**, and that experience left me with a **lifelong aversion to chemistry**.
- It also pushed me further toward interests like **electronics, music, and computing**.
- I did take one **college chemistry course**, but struggled to stay interested. I ended up **just reading the textbook**, taking the **final exam**, and scoring a **90**, which **blew the curve** — much to the frustration of my classmates.

- After we moved to **Douglaston** when I was **12 years old**, my parents gave me **two weeks of golf lessons** from the pro at the **Douglaston Golf Course**, which was right across the street from our new home.
  - I took to golf immediately, and for the first time in my life, I was able to **beat the school athletes** at a game they cared about.
  - This marked a **turning point in my confidence**.
  - In the **summers after school was over**, when I was younger, my mother used to take me to the **beach** with her every morning.
  - But once I learned to play golf, I would play **every single day**.
  - I played the **Douglaston Golf Course**, which I could walk to, and I had a **golf pass from the city** that let me play for just **75 cents a round**.
  - I also learned a very important lesson early on the golf course.
  - Being a naturally helpful person who understood things deeply, I had the urge to help other players with their golf swings when I saw them struggling.
  - But I quickly learned that **unsolicited help**, even if well-meaning, often led to **bad reactions**.
  - That experience taught me an early and lasting rule: **never give advice on a golf course unless someone asks for it**.
- Around age **15 or 16**, I had a powerful realization — it came either from a dream or my subconscious: that **everything in life is cyclical**.
  - Everything has a **beginning**, and eventually, an **end** — some things end sooner, some later.
  - This insight profoundly shaped how I approached life: it made me **adaptable**, more **accepting of change**, and better at **moving on** when things ended.
  - An extreme example of this is how I responded to being fired from **Xedex** — I immediately pivoted and went on to start **Techland Systems**.
- I discovered I thrived in **competitive environments** — not just golf, but also **bowling**, and even **archery**, where I won a **trophy at day camp at age 14**.
- These early competitive outlets shaped me profoundly. They helped me build confidence, learn to focus under pressure, and ultimately gave me the mindset that carried into tech and business.
- I’ve always had a strong sense of **independence**, even as a child — but my **rebelliousness** didn’t really emerge until I started **college**.
- Learned to drive from both my **mother and father** in **early 1968**, shortly before I started college.
- Joined the **New York Audio Society** and regularly attended their meetings.  
- At **age 18**, I subscribed to the **New York Philharmonic** and would attend concerts with my brother.  
- As with all things I’m passionate about, I dove deep — I’ve always been **insatiably curious**, and **audio technology** became a serious pursuit.  
- Studied under **Dr. Banesh Hoffmann** at **Queens College**  
  - A renowned physicist and mathematician best known for co-authoring *Relativity: The Special and the General Theory* with **Albert Einstein**.  
  - Hoffmann had been one of Einstein’s closest collaborators and advocates, helping defend and communicate the ideas of general relativity.  
  - He became a **mentor and advocate** for me during my college years and had a profound influence on my thinking.  
  - He wrote me an extraordinary **letter of recommendation**, calling me *“the best student I’ve had in 30 years of teaching”* and saying he *expected big things from me*.  
  - That letter has remained one of my most cherished acknowledgments — and a reminder of the power of mentorship in shaping a life.  
  - Hoffmann inspired in me a love for **systems thinking**, abstraction, and intellectual rigor that I carried into computing, strategy, and innovation.

<summary><strong>Innovating in Noise Cancellation (1985–1990)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- After leaving Techland, I was invited by **Mike Parella** to help **restructure Noise Cancellation Technologies (NCTI)**, a public company in Miami.
- I was tasked with **securing the patent rights to the Chaplin patent for systematic noise cancellation from **Professor Peter Chaplin** at the **University of Essex** in the UK.
- When I arrived, the team at Essex was skeptical due to past management experiences, but I **smoothed things over** and closed the deal for **£100,000**.
- Returning to the U.S., I sent **Eldon Ziegler** to Miami to evaluate NCT’s technical assets. His report: fire everyone and start from scratch.
- I hired Eldon as **VP of Engineering**, and he set up a new **lab in Columbia, Maryland**, while I ran operations from **Great Neck, NY**.
- I hired about a dozen people to rebuild the company, and **John McCloy Jr.** joined the team soon after.

### Diplomacy and Defense

- Each week I’d fly to **Baltimore** to work with Eldon and return to New York.
- I visited **John McCloy Sr.** — John Jr.’s father — in **Greenwich**, and had a deep, inspiring conversation.
- **John Sr.** was widely considered the most influential **private citizen of the 20th century**, having negotiated the **Cuban Missile Crisis settlement**.
- John Jr. introduced me to high-level contacts, including the **U.S. Secretary of Defense**, whom we met at the **Pentagon**.
- We sold some systems to the military and traveled together to **Berlin** and **Munich**.
- In **Berlin**, McCloy was treated like royalty — we attended **Herbert von Karajan’s final concert** of **Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony**.
- One day I crossed into **East Berlin** with a friend of McCloy’s. It was eerie — a surreal walk through a very different world.

### Boeing and Beyond

- In **1989**, I flew to **Seattle** to help close a deal with **Boeing**.
- The flight was repeatedly delayed and left at **3:00 AM**, putting me in the middle seat between **two nuns**.
- Despite no sleep, I performed well and closed the deal.
- I continued leading NCT until mid-1990, when I sold my **York Research stock** after settling litigation.

<summary><strong>Next Chapter: 1990s–2000</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- In **late 1990**, I got my first real connection to the **Internet**, using **PPP over a modem**.
- My initial ISP was **Pipeline.com**, which would later become **MindSpring.com**.
- I quickly became adept at using early **web browsers** like **Netscape**, and began exploring the growing universe of online content.

- After receiving the **York Research settlement** in the summer of 1990, I also began learning about **investing**.
- I took courses at the **New York Institute of Finance** with renowned technician **Ralph Acampora**, gaining insight into **how markets worked**.
- I revisited software from **AIQ Systems**, a company I had helped during my Lifeboat days, and began actively using it in my trading and analysis.

- I attended an **AIQ seminar** in **Miami**, where I first saw the potential of applying technical software to **futures market analysis**.
- At the time, I was already running the **first version of TradeStation** on my home computer, connected to a **Signal data feed** via a crude **FM antenna**.
- Inspired by the seminar, I began building my **first futures trading system**, which was generating **profitable signals**.
- The challenge was **order execution** — there was no efficient way to get trades to the **futures pits** in real time.
- Working with **Eldon Ziegler** and my **broker**, we created a modem-based pipeline to transmit the trades for manual entry.
- This system — developed in **1993–1994** — was effectively my **first trading bot**.

- I later installed a **satellite dish on my roof** to feed TradeStation with better data.
- One day, while playing golf, I got a call from my broker: the system was up **$150,000**. I told him to let it run — it finished the day up **$340,000**.

- In **November 1991**, JoAnn and I bought a home in **Old Brookville, Long Island**, and moved in during the first half of 1992.
- Sadly, my **father died in 1994**, followed by my **mother** six months later. In **1996**, **JoAnn’s mother** passed away as well.

- Through my growing relationships with **casino executives (CNOs)**, I gained rare access to **golf courses**, **fights**, and **Super Bowls**.
- I attended major events like the **Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Hagler** fight in 1988, and was regularly invited to championship events.
- One highlight was the infamous **Tyson vs. Holyfield bite fight**, where I saw chaos break out in the MGM Grand and casino.
- During the 1990s, I also played over **140 rounds at Shadow Creek**, including a month where I played daily with **Kenny Green** as he rehabbed for the tour.

- I attended the **Studio 54 opening** at MGM, with **Elton John** performing for hours and drinks with **Tony Curtis**.
- At the **Bellagio opening**, JoAnn and I were flown by private jet and checked in on the runway, attending a private concert by **Van Cliburn**.

<summary><strong>Leading Techland Systems (1982–1985)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- After leaving Xedex in 1982, I founded **Techland Systems Inc.**, taking my entire team with me.
- I brought on **Richard Clowes**, a top former IBM salesperson, as **VP of Sales**.
- With the support of **Neil Colvin** and **Mike Aaronson**, I was introduced to **Reed Smith** and his colleague **Bob**, who had developed **3270 terminal emulation software**.
- This became the foundation of **BlueLynx**, our flagship product.
- Ironically, had things played out differently, BlueLynx might have become part of the Xedex product line — but instead, it was the core of something much bigger.
- **Techland** would ultimately earn me **$3.3 million**, but that payoff came years later.

### BlueLynx and TwinX

- **BlueLynx** provided **3270/5250 terminal emulation** and full **SNA/SDLC** mainframe connectivity.
- A **1984 DataPro report** praised it as a standout solution. ([Bitsavers PDF](https://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/datapro/protocol_conversion_systems/C23-825_Techland_Systems.pdf))
- It could emulate a **5251 Model 12** terminal and support **5256 printers**.
- We also released **TwinX**, a product that enabled Twinax connectivity to **IBM System/34 and 36**.

### Expansion and Growth

- In our first year, Richard Clowes brought in **$2 million in revenue**, landing major clients like **RJR Reynolds**, **New England Life**, and the **Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco**.
- We grew to **50 employees** and opened offices at **Waterside Plaza** on the East River in New York.
- We launched a **Techland subsidiary in London**, run by Richard’s brother.
- Richard and I often flew over on the **Concorde**, and we expanded manufacturing by arranging **cost-effective hardware production in Malaysia**.

> On one such trip: we flew Concorde to London, then first-class via Singapore Airlines to China with stops in the New Territories and Bombay, and returned to NYC on Concorde — the entire journey cost just **$1,500 per person**.

### Eldon Ziegler and Product Development

- I wanted to build a personal information manager and asked **Neil Colvin** for a recommendation.
- He referred me to **Eldon Ziegler**, the best software developer he knew.
- Eldon joined to work on **a single software product** and delivered incredible results.
- Later, I would hire him again — this time as **VP of Engineering at NCTI** — where he played a much larger role in shaping the company.
- Over time, he became a **lifelong friend and collaborator**.

### Sale and Aftermath

- In **1985**, we were approached by **Bob Benningson** of **York Research**, who wanted to acquire Techland.
- After a year of negotiations, we sold Techland and became a **public company**.
- Within a month, I discovered the new owners had stopped **paying payroll taxes** to save cash.
- On the advice of my lawyers, I resigned immediately.
- York Research later **sued to reclaim our stock**, launching litigation that lasted until **1990**.
- That summer, Benningson settled with me, and I sold all my York shares for **$3.3 million**.
- The other original shareholders persisted and ultimately **won their case in 1991**.

<summary><strong>Xedex & BabyBlue (1981–1982)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- In **1981**, I was approached by **Mike Aaronson**, who needed help raising funds for a Z80-based coprocessor card he had developed.
- His invention would allow the **IBM PC**, which had just been released, to run **CP/M programs** — a huge deal since most useful software still ran on CP/M.
- I helped him structure a deal to raise **$10,000**, and in the process decided to leave Lifeboat and form a new venture.
- I teamed up with **Roland Joffe** (head of marketing at Lifeboat), his assistant **Rebecka**, and engineer **Bob Hassel**, and we founded **Xedex**.
- Roland established our main office in a **house on 6th Avenue in Burlington**, and hired top PR firm **Burson-Marsteller** to handle publicity.
- Bob opened a production office in **Suffern, New York**, where he began manufacturing what we called **BabyBlue**.
- Within five months, we were shipping product and getting strong coverage in the press.

> 📰 In **February 1982**, UPI reported:
> “XEDEX President Harris Landgarten said Baby Blue ‘will make the IBM machine more versatile than an Apple or a Tandy microcomputer in terms …’” — [UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/02/17/A-5-week-old-computer-company-Wednesday-unveiled-a-product-it/5338382770000)

- I knew early on that the **hardware and software had a limited shelf life** — the industry was evolving rapidly.
- Unfortunately, in late 1982 I discovered that **Bob Hassel** was sabotaging the hardware and had made a deal with the investor to **force me out**.
- I was **fired**, and took my team with me to start **Techland Systems**.
- Although I had to leave BabyBlue behind, I wasn't bitter. I had helped birth an idea and a product that was real — and I was about to do something even more impactful.
- It's worth noting that **BabyBlue II**, a later version of the product, was developed **after I had left the company**.

<summary><strong>Working at Lifeboat Associates (1980–1981)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- In **1979**, I got a call from **Tony Gold**, president of Lifeboat Associates, inviting me to join the company.
- In **1980**, I left my family's plumbing supply business to take the leap into software.
- At Lifeboat, I edited and published our newsletter, **Lifelines**, and one of my main responsibilities was writing a **weekly editorial**.
- These editorials discussed industry trends and often highlighted **technical issues** or **bugs** in common tools and compilers.
- I took pride in **documenting compiler bugs** — particularly in BASIC — to help fellow programmers avoid pitfalls.
- This transparency occasionally sparked backlash, especially from **Bill Gates**, who would personally call to complain when I published bugs related to Microsoft BASIC.
- Still, I believed in giving developers clear, honest information to work with.

### Industry Collaboration

- I negotiated **royalty contracts** with independent developers and third-party software authors.
- These included major relationships:
  - **Micro Focus** – COBOL compilers  
  - **Peter Rozen** – TMaker  
  - **Balcones Software** – accounting systems  
  - I frequently traveled to **Austin, TX** to coordinate with Balcones.

### Ford & Microsoft

- I helped **Ford Motor Company** develop its **early PC strategy**, and flew solo to present at their **Renaissance Center** headquarters in Detroit.
- Around that time, I also attended an **Intel conference in Oregon** with **Neil Colvin**.
- After the conference, **Bill Gates** personally gave Neil and me a tour of what would become **Microsoft’s first campus** in **Redmond**.
- At that moment, Microsoft had only leased **half the building**, but it was clear they were on the brink of something much larger.
- It was one of those moments that reminded me how far I'd come — from a quiet, technical kid to someone confidently speaking to senior execs at a Fortune 500 company.

### BIOS Opportunity

- I also worked closely with **Neil Colvin** of Phoenix Technologies and **Mike Aaronson**.
- I tested early BIOS products like **P-Mate**, and I was the one who first suggested there was a market need for a **third-party BIOS** — an idea that became foundational to the PC clone industry.

<summary><strong>My Beginning in Computers (1975–1980)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- After graduating college, I remained deeply interested in electronics and computing.
- Frustrated by early Fortran programming using **punch cards** and long turnaround times, I was eager for more immediate feedback.
- I built a number of **advanced Heathkits**, including a **digital FM receiver**.
- I ordered one of the first **HP-85** calculators and used it for physics calculations — it replaced the slide rule.

### Enter the Altair

- In 1973, I bought an **audio sweep generator kit** from **MITS** to align tape heads on my **TEAC** reel-to-reel.
- MITS later sent me a **$100 discount certificate**, and when they introduced the **Altair 8800** in *Popular Electronics* (1975), I ordered the kit immediately.
- Built it myself — it had **256 bytes of RAM** and blinking LEDs.

### BASIC Changes Everything

- I later upgraded the Altair to **4 KB of RAM** and loaded **Microsoft BASIC** from **paper tape**.
- It was the first time I could write code and get immediate results — a major shift from the delayed punch card workflows.

### Building Real Software

- After graduating in **December 1975**, I worked full-time at **Ace Brass**, my father's business.
- I had moved out of my parents' house in **1974** and was living in an apartment when I met **JoAnn** in December 1975.
- We were married on **May 6, 1978**, and bought our **first house in Douglaston** a year later, in **1979** — a major step forward in both our personal and professional lives.
- During this time — between graduation and my joining **Lifeboat Associates** — I had the opportunity to write several complete software systems.
- I purchased an **IMSAI Z-80 system** and developed a full **invoicing, packing list, and accounts receivable system** in BASIC for the business.
- Storage was done on **cassette tape** — floppy drives were not yet available.
- The system ran **CP/M**, and I sourced software from **Lifeboat Associates**, where I would later go on to work.

> That Altair wasn’t just my first PC. It was the **gateway to a lifelong career in tech**.

<summary><strong>College and the Draft (1968–1975)</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

- I started college at **Queens College in fall 1968**, during the height of the **Vietnam draft**.
- I registered for the **draft on my 18th birthday**, but had a **college deferment** as long as I stayed enrolled.
- To stretch that deferment, I only registered for **12 credits per term**.
- I began as a **Computer Science major**, but after my first year, **Queens College dropped required courses** — which meant I no longer had to take English classes that didn’t interest me.
- From then on, I only took courses that **captivated me** — **physics**, **math**, **business law** — but continued at a slow pace.
- I enjoyed getting involved in my **house plan**, didn’t push myself too hard, and pursued my interests on my own terms.
- I joined the **Queens College golf team**, where I met **Danny Rosenthal**, who would later become a longtime friend and **CFO of Techland Systems**.
- In **August 1969**, I attended **Woodstock** with some friends. On the drive up, our car **overheated**, forcing us to **pull over and wait by the side of the road** while it cooled.
  - We eventually made it to the festival, where we joined hundreds of thousands in the **mud and music** — an experience that left a lasting impression.
- I was also an **avid bowler** in college — I competed on multiple **five-man teams**, participating in **Kegler tournaments** on weekends.
  - We did well, and I won numerous **trophies**, including one for bowling a **278 game** — 11 strikes followed by 8 pins — just shy of a perfect 300.
  - I received a **special trophy** for that achievement.

- In **1972**, my father became ill, and I took a **leave of absence** from college to run the family business, **Ace Brass**.
- My **grandfather**, who died right around the time I was born, had been a partner in a larger business called **Sanitary-Dash**, where both my father and his twin brother worked.
- When I was around **four or five**, Sanitary-Dash decided to relocate its operations to **Worcester, Massachusetts**.
- My father and mother didn’t want to move, so my father left the company and started a **smaller business**, founding **Ace Brass Manufacturing** in **Brooklyn**.
- Ace Brass had a compact but capable factory setup with **cutting machines, dealing machines, punch presses, threading machines, and saw sharpeners**.
- During that year, I learned to **set up and operate all the machines** myself.

- When I returned to school, the **draft was no longer a concern** — I had a high **lottery number**, declared myself **1-A**, and was no longer at risk.
- I decided to **re-dedicate myself to finishing school**, switching to a **Math major** since I had already accumulated the most credits in that area.
- I entered a full-on **learning sprint**, taking **18 credits per term**, plus **summer courses**.
- It was during this time that I studied under **Dr. Banesh Hoffmann**, who became a pivotal mentor.
- I graduated in **December 1975** — the same month I met **my future wife, JoAnn**.
- We were married on **May 6, 1978**.
