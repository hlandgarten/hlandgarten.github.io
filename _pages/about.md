<summary><strong>My Beginning in Computers</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

### ✅ Before Lifeboat. Before Microsoft BASIC. Before the PC boom… I was already building.

- I had:
  - A **Teletype Model 33 ASR** for output  
  - A **one-line LED terminal** for input  
  - A **cassette tape** for storage  
- I wrote a complete **pack list, invoice, and A/R posting system** in BASIC—on that hardware  
- Then came the **Altair 8800**, and **paper tape**  
- I ran Microsoft BASIC and watched it display its name—on that same LED terminal

> *I wasn’t just watching the birth of personal computing.  
> I was helping raise it.*
