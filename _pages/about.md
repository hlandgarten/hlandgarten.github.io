## My Beginning in Computers

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Before Lifeboat. Before Microsoft BASIC. Before the PC boom‚Ä¶**  
I was already building.

I had a **Teletype Model 33 ASR** for output and a **one-line LED terminal** for input. My storage? A **cassette tape**. I wrote a complete **pack list, invoice, and A/R posting system** in BASIC‚Äîon that hardware.

It was primitive, but it automated hours of work.

Then came the **Altair 8800**. When I ran Microsoft BASIC from **paper tape** and saw it greet me on that LED terminal, I knew the future had arrived.

> I wasn‚Äôt just watching the birth of personal computing.  
> I was helping raise it.

## The BabyBlue Breakthrough

In **1982**, I was president of **XEDEX**, creators of **BabyBlue**‚Äîa device that allowed the IBM PC to run **CP/M software**, bridging a crucial compatibility gap.

> ‚ÄúIt gives you all the advantages of the IBM hardware plus the ability to run the enormous base of CP/M software.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Harris Landgarten*, UPI interview, 1982

BabyBlue dramatically expanded the IBM PC‚Äôs software base and helped establish it as a universal platform.

## Leading Techland Systems

As **President of Techland Systems** (until 1985), I focused on **protocol conversion systems**‚Äîthe glue between incompatible computing systems.

Techland made it possible for minicomputers, PCs, and mainframes to **talk to each other**, laying groundwork for the interoperability that defines computing today.

See the [archived brochure on Bitsavers](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/datapro/protocol_conversion_systems/C23-825_Techland_Systems.pdf).

## Innovating in Noise Cancellation

<details>

In the late '80s, I helped pioneer **active noise and vibration cancellation** at **NCTI**, working alongside **John McCloy Jr.**.

We demonstrated early systems that could cancel real-world acoustic disturbances‚Äîtechnology still used today in everything from industrial systems to headphones.

## Before the Machines

üé∏ I was at **Woodstock**, surrounded by mud, music, and revolution. That moment shaped my values and vision.

üìö I studied under **Dr. Hoffman** at **Queens College**, who sparked my early interest in systems thinking and philosophy‚Äîcore ideas that would shape my engineering and leadership for decades.
