<div markdown="1">

* At **16**, I started college as a **Computer Science major** at **Queens College**.
* The school had only a **Xerox-built mainframe**, and all programming was in **Fortran** via **punch cards**.
* You’d type each line onto a punch card, submit a stack, and wait **a week** for results—often discovering only a syntax error.
* Frustrated by this process and poor instruction, I left the major—but not my passion for computing.
