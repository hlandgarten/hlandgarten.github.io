## My Beginning in Computers

Before I ever joined Lifeboat Associates… before I worked under Ed Curry, or sat in the meeting that launched *PC Magazine*… I was writing software on a cassette tape.

I had a **Teletype Model 33 ASR** for output, and a one-line LED terminal for input. My storage medium? A standard audio cassette. That’s where I saved the business software I wrote: a full **pack list, invoice, and accounts receivable posting system**, all in BASIC.

It was clunky. It was slow. But it worked—and it automated a process that would’ve taken hours by hand.

Then came the **Altair 8800**, and with it, paper tape. The moment I ran **Microsoft BASIC** and saw it print its name on a single line of that LED terminal was unforgettable. That was a shift. The future was no longer something coming—it had arrived.

I wasn’t just watching the birth of personal computing. I was helping raise it.

## The BabyBlue Breakthrough

In 1982, I was president of XEDEX, the company behind a groundbreaking device called **BabyBlue**—a hardware add-on that allowed the IBM PC to run CP/M software. At the time, CP/M represented the bulk of available personal computing programs, but IBM’s new microcomputer wasn’t compatible. BabyBlue changed that.

As quoted in a February 1982 *United Press International* article:

> “It gives you all the advantages of the IBM hardware plus the ability to run the enormous base of CP/M software.” — *Harris Landgarten*, President of XEDEX

With BabyBlue, the IBM PC could suddenly run a vast library of software—immediately expanding its usefulness and accelerating its adoption. It was a bridge between computing generations and helped position the PC as a dominant platform in the years that followed.

## Leading Techland Systems

Following my time at XEDEX, I became **President of Techland Systems**, where I remained until 1985. Techland specialized in **protocol conversion systems**—the hardware and firmware bridges that allowed disparate computing systems to communicate with one another.

The protocol conversion field was an essential, though often overlooked, foundation of enterprise computing in the early 1980s. It allowed mainframes, minicomputers, and personal computers—often from different manufacturers with incompatible standards—to work together in business environments.

Techland’s contributions played a role in the broader narrative of computing interoperability that would eventually lead to the development of networked systems, and later, the internet.

Documents like the [Techland Systems brochure archived by Bitsavers](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/datapro/protocol_conversion_systems/C23-825_Techland_Systems.pdf) illustrate the kind of cutting-edge work we were doing during that period.

## Innovating in Noise Cancellation

By 1988, I had turned my attention to a different kind of problem: noise. I worked with **NCTI (Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc.)**, where I collaborated with **John McCloy Jr.** on breakthrough developments in **active noise and vibration control**.

As noted in a *New York Times* article dated March 2, 1988, titled *"Business Technology; You Can't Stand the Noise? Get an Anti-Noise Machine"*, I was at the forefront of **noise and vibration cancellation technology**.

The article highlights both the market potential and technical challenges of active noise control, noting that my company was focused on addressing real-world acoustic problems. This pioneering work laid the foundation for innovations that are still in use today, from industrial soundproofing to noise-canceling consumer products.

## Before the Machines: Woodstock and Dr. Hoffman

But even before computers, my life was touched by the revolutionary spirit of the 1960s and 70s. I was at **Woodstock**, swept up in the chaos, music, and movement that defined a generation. It was an experience that shaped my view of freedom, systems, and disruption—not just in society, but in technology too.

Not long after, I studied under **Dr. Hoffman** at **Queens College**. His influence wasn’t just academic—it was philosophical. He helped me see systems of thought, organization, and creativity that would later guide my engineering and entrepreneurial work.

From cassette tapes to paper tape, from software to hardware, from standalone systems to networked protocols—and even into the acoustic domain—my early journey through computing reflects both the rapid evolution of the industry and the constant need for individuals willing to innovate ahead of the curve.
