## My Beginning in Computers

<div markdown="1">

* At **16**, I started college as a **Computer Science major** at **Queens College**.

* The school had only a **Xerox-built mainframe**, and all programming was in **Fortran** via **punch cards**.

* You’d type each line onto a punch card, submit a stack, and wait **a week** for results—often discovering only a syntax error.

* Frustrated by this process and poor instruction, I left the major—but not my passion for computing.

* Built advanced **Heathkits**, ending with a **digital FM receiver**.

* Ordered one of the first **HP-85** calculators—waited **three months** for delivery.

* Used it in place of a slide rule during physics courses.

### Enter the Altair

* Bought an **audio sweep generator kit** from **MITS** in 1973 to align tape heads on my **TEAC** reel-to-reel.
* MITS sent me a **\$100 discount certificate** in 1974.
* When the **Altair 8800** was introduced in *Popular Electronics*, I ordered one immediately—in kit form.
* Built it myself: it had just **256 bytes of memory** and blinking LEDs.

### BASIC Changed Everything

* Upgraded to **4 KB of RAM** and received **Microsoft BASIC on paper tape**.
* For the first time, I could **write code and get instant results**.
* This was a revelation after the week-long delays in college labs.

### Building Real Software

* Bought an **IMSAI Z-80 system** and wrote a full **invoicing, packing list, and A/R system** in BASIC for my father’s business.
* Stored everything on **cassette tape**—no floppy disks yet.
* Ran **CP/M**, and bought software from **Lifeboat Associates**.

> That Altair wasn’t just my first PC.
> It was the gateway to a career in tech.
