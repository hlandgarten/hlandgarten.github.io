## My Beginning in Computers

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

**Before Lifeboat. Before Microsoft BASIC. Before the PC boom…** I was already building.

I had a **Teletype Model 33 ASR** for output and a **one-line LED terminal** for input. My storage? A **cassette tape**.

I wrote a complete **pack list, invoice, and A/R posting system** in BASIC—on that hardware. It was primitive, but it automated hours of work.

Then came the **Altair 8800**. When I ran Microsoft BASIC from **paper tape** and saw it greet me on that LED terminal, I knew the future had arrived.

> I wasn’t just watching the birth of personal computing.  
> I was helping raise it.

## The BabyBlue Breakthrough

<details>

In **1982**, I was president of **XEDEX**, creators of **BabyBlue**—a device that allowed the IBM PC to run **CP/M software**, bridging a crucial compatibility gap.

> “It gives you all the advantages of the IBM hardware plus the ability to run the enormous base of CP/M software.”  
> — *Harris Landgarten*, UPI interview, 1982

BabyBlue dramatically expanded the IBM PC’s software base and helped establish it as a universal platform.

As **President of Techland Systems** (until 1985), I focused on **protocol conversion systems**—the glue between incompatible computing systems.

Techland made it possible for **minicomputers**, **PCs**, and **mainframes** to **talk to each other**, laying groundwork for the interoperability that defines computing today.

See the [archived brochure on Bitsavers](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/datapro/protocol_conversion_systems/C23-825_Techland_Systems.pdf).

## Innovating in Noise Cancellation

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

By **1988**, I had shifted my focus to a new frontier: **sound**.

I joined **Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc. (NCTI)**, working alongside **John McCloy Jr.** to pioneer breakthroughs in **active noise and vibration control**.

The idea was radical at the time—canceling sound not with insulation, but with **precision-engineered anti-sound**.

📰 **Featured in The New York Times**  
> “You Can't Stand the Noise? Get an Anti-Noise Machine”  
> — *The New York Times*, March 2, 1988, Page D6

Earlier, science correspondent **William J. Broad** also covered our innovations:  
> “New Technology Defeats Unwanted Noise”  
> — *The New York Times*, June 30, 1987  
> *(Subscription required)*

🛠️ **Our work targeted**:  
- Factories  
- Fans  
- Engines  
- Vibration systems  

💡 **Wider recognition included**:  
- A feature in *The Economist*  
- A **live demo on Good Morning America**, showing vibration cancellation in a **pool of water**  
- An interview on *Innovation TV* about the future of acoustic control  

This early work helped lay the foundation for today’s **active noise-canceling technologies** in **headphones**, **cars**, and **industry**.

## Before the Machines

<details>

🎸 I was at **Woodstock**, surrounded by mud, music, and revolution. That moment shaped my values and vision.

📚 I studied under **Dr. Hoffman** at **Queens College**, who sparked my early interest in **systems thinking** and **philosophy**—core ideas that would shape my engineering and leadership for decades.
