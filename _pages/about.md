<summary><strong>My Beginning in Computers</strong></summary>

<br>

### ✅ Before Lifeboat. Before Microsoft BASIC. Before the PC boom…

I was already building.

- **Teletype Model 33 ASR** for output  
- **One-line LED terminal** for input  
- **Cassette tape** for storage  
- Wrote a full **pack list, invoice, and A/R system in BASIC**

Then came the **Altair 8800** and **paper tape**. I ran Microsoft BASIC and saw it greet me.

> *I wasn’t just watching the birth of personal computing.  
> I was helping raise it.*
