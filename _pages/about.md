## My Beginning in Computers

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

- Before Lifeboat. Before Microsoft BASIC. Before the PC boom… I was already building.
- My setup:
  - **Teletype Model 33 ASR** for output
  - **One-line LED terminal** for input
  - **Cassette tape** for storage
- I built a full **pack list, invoice, and A/R system in BASIC** on that hardware.
- Then came the **Altair 8800**, and **paper tape**. I ran Microsoft BASIC and watched it display its name—on that same LED terminal.
- That’s when I knew the future had arrived.

> *I wasn’t just watching the birth of personal computing.  
> I was helping raise it.*
