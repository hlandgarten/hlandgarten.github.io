## My Beginning in Computers

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

* At **16**, I started college as a **Computer Science major** at **Queens College**.
* The school had only a **Xerox-built mainframe**, and all programming was in **Fortran** via **punch cards**.
* You’d type each line onto a punch card, submit a stack, and wait **a week** for results—often discovering only a syntax error.
* Frustrated by this process and poor instruction, I left the major—but not my passion for computing.

### My DIY Hardware Evolution

* Built advanced **Heathkits**, ending with a **digital FM receiver**.
* Ordered one of the first **HP-85** calculators—waited **three months** for delivery.
* Used it in place of a slide rule during physics courses.

### Enter the Altair

* Bought an **audio sweep generator kit** from **MITS** in 1973 to align tape heads on my **TEAC** reel-to-reel.
* MITS sent me a **\$100 discount certificate** in 1974.
* When the **Altair 8800** was introduced in *Popular Electronics*, I ordered one immediately—in kit form.
* Built it myself: it had just **256 bytes of memory** and blinking LEDs.

### BASIC Changed Everything

* Upgraded to **4 KB of RAM** and received **Microsoft BASIC on paper tape**.
* For the first time, I could **write code and get instant results**.
* This was a revelation after the week-long delays in college labs.

### Building Real Software

* Bought an **IMSAI Z-80 system** and wrote a full **invoicing, packing list, and A/R system** in BASIC for my father’s business.
* Stored everything on **cassette tape**—no floppy disks yet.
* Ran **CP/M**, and bought software from **Lifeboat Associates**.

> That Altair wasn’t just my first PC.
> It was the gateway to a career in tech.

<div markdown="1">

* In **1979**, **Tony Gold** (President of Lifeboat) called and offered me a job.
* In **1980**, I left my family’s plumbing supply business and joined **Lifeboat Associates**.

### Key Contributions:

* Edited and published **Lifelines**, our customer newsletter.

  * I openly documented **bugs in major software** — sparking strong reactions, including from **Bill Gates**.
* Negotiated **royalty contracts** with prominent developers.

### Industry Collaboration:

* **Micro Focus** – COBOL compilers
* **Peter Rozen** – TMaker
* **Balcones Software** (Austin, TX) – advanced accounting

  * Traveled there frequently

### Ford & Microsoft

* Helped **Ford Motor Company** develop its **early PC strategy**.

  * Presented at the **Renaissance Center** in Detroit.
* After an Intel conference in Oregon, **Bill Gates** gave **Neil Colvin** and me a personal tour of **Microsoft’s first Redmond campus**.

  * They had only leased **half** the building at the time!

### Behind the Scenes with Bill Gates

* Discussed his mission to stop **software piracy**.

  * His idea: **OEM bundling** — software pre-installed on computers.
* This approach led to deals with **Tandy**, among others.
* Ironically, it also laid the foundation for Microsoft’s **antitrust troubles**.

### BIOS Opportunity

* Had a close partnership with **Neil Colvin** (Phoenix Technologies).
* Tested **P-Mate** for **Mike Aaronson**, Neil’s friend.
* I was the one who suggested the market need for **third-party BIOS**—vital to launching the **IBM PC clone industry**.

> I didn’t get a commission—but I helped launch an industry.

<summary><strong>Xedex & BabyBlue</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

> 📰 In **February 1982**, UPI reported:
>
> “XEDEX President Harris Landgarten said Baby Blue ‘will make the IBM machine more versatile than an Apple or a Tandy microcomputer in terms …’”
> — [UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/02/17/A-5-week-old-computer-company-Wednesday-unveiled-a-product-it/5338382770000)

* ![BabyBlue Board](/assets/images/babyblue-card.jpg)
  *Original Xedex BabyBlue Z80 Coprocessor Card*

* BabyBlue was also advertised in **Byte Magazine** and **PC Magazine** in mid-1982, and the [Baby Blue CPU Plus User’s Manual (v1.2)](https://www.minuszerodegrees.net/manuals/Microlog/Baby%20Blue%20CPU%20Plus%20-%20User%27s%20Manual%20-%20Version%201.2.pdf) remains archived today.

* **Burson-Marsteller**, one of the top public relations firms in the country, was hired to promote BabyBlue.

* Thanks to their efforts, Xedex received significant media coverage in **1982**, including press features and product reviews that helped establish BabyBlue's reputation early in the PC industry.

* In **1981**, I was approached by **Mike Aaronson**. His son needed an important operation, and he asked me to help structure a deal through which he could receive **\$10,000** for his invention.

* In exchange, he offered rights to a **Z80-based coprocessor** he had developed that, when installed in an **IBM PC**, allowed it to run **CP/M programs** not available for the 8086.

* I put together a deal and left **Lifeboat** with **Roland Joffe** (head of marketing), his assistant **Rebecka**, and **Bob Hassel** (engineer and BIOS programmer).

* Together we founded **Xedex** to build and market the coprocessor, which we named **BabyBlue**.

* Roland Joffe founded our main office in a Burlington house on **6th Avenue**, and also hired **Burson-Marsteller** as our public relations agency. Meanwhile, Bob opened an office in **Suffern, NY** to manufacture the boards.

* Within five months, we were shipping — and BabyBlue quickly earned **tremendous press and notoriety**. I wasn’t upset about leaving, though — I knew from the start that BabyBlue’s software and hardware had a **limited lifespan**. Ironically, the investor who sided with Hassel was left with a product that had little future — while I was free to build something more enduring at Techland.

* It's important to note that the later **BabyBlue II** version was developed **after I left Xedex**. My direct involvement was with the original BabyBlue and the formation and early success of the company.

<summary><strong>Leading Techland Systems</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

* In **late 1982**, I discovered that **Bob Hassel** had been sabotaging our hardware at Xedex.
* He had made a deal with the investor to take over the company.
* I was informed that I was **fired**, and in response, I took my entire team and launched a new company: **Techland Systems Inc.**.
* As part of building Techland, we brought in **Richard Clowes**, a former top IBM salesperson, as **VP of Sales**.
* Understanding our situation, **Neil Colvin** and **Mike Aaronson** connected me with **Reed Smith** and his friend **Bob**, who had developed **3270 emulation software** that would evolve into **BlueLynx**. Techland Systems Inc.'s BlueLynx product line was widely recognized in the industry for enabling seamless PC-to-mainframe communications.

### Product Spotlight: BlueLynx & TwinX

* Techland’s **BlueLynx** product line offered robust **3270/5250 terminal emulation** for IBM mainframe connectivity, supporting **SNA/SDLC** networks.
* A 1984 **DataPro industry report** named BlueLynx a standout in protocol conversion systems. ([View report on Bitsavers](https://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/datapro/protocol_conversion_systems/C23-825_Techland_Systems.pdf))
* BlueLynx made the PC appear to the host as a **5251 Model 12** terminal and could interface with **5256 dot-matrix printers**.
* In addition, we developed **TwinX**, a solution for **local connectivity to IBM System/34 and System/36** minicomputers using **Twinaxial cabling**.
* These offerings gave Techland a critical edge in enterprise integration, enabling PCs to function within established IBM midrange environments.
  A 1984 **DataPro industry report** featured BlueLynx as a standout protocol conversion system compatible with **IBM 3270/5251 terminal emulation**, supporting **SNA/SDLC** networks. You can view the original document [here (Bitsavers)](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/datapro/protocol_conversion_systems/C23-825_Techland_Systems.pdf). Had I been dealt with honestly, BlueLynx would likely have become part of Xedex’s product line. Ultimately, Techland proved to be a far better outcome — it eventually earned me **\$3.3 million**, though that part of the story comes later. In the first year alone, **Richard brought in \$2 million in sales**, landing major clients like **RJR Reynolds**, **New England Life**, and the **Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco**. Pretty soon, we had **50 employees** and offices at **Waterside Plaza** on the East River in New York. We also launched a **Techland Systems Inc. subsidiary in London**, run by **Richard Clowes' brother**. Richard and I would fly over on the **Concorde** a couple of times a year. We also flew to **Singapore**, where we arranged lower-cost manufacturing for BlueLynx hardware in **Malaysia**. This was during a time when the **U.S. dollar was at an all-time high**, and we could buy very inexpensive airfares from London. On one memorable trip, we flew from **New York to London on the Concorde**, then **first-class on Singapore Airlines** to **China**, where we spent a few days (including in the **New Territories**), then flew to **Singapore**, and returned to **London via Bombay**, again flying **first-class on Singapore Airlines**, and finally flew back to **New York on the Concorde**. The entire round-the-world itinerary cost just **\$1,500 per person**. While at Techland Systems Inc., we also wanted to develop a personal information management software product. I asked **Neil Colvin** for a recommendation, and he pointed me to **Eldon Ziegler**, the best application software programmer he knew. We hired Eldon, who did a tremendous job. He not only built excellent software but became a close friend and lifelong collaborator. In **1985**, we were approached by **Bob Benningson** of **York Research**, who expressed interest in acquiring Techland. After a year of negotiation, we finalized the deal — **Techland Systems Inc. was sold to York Research**, and we became a **public company**. Within a month of the merger, I discovered that the new owners, in an effort to conserve cash, had **stopped paying payroll taxes**. My lawyers advised me to **resign immediately**. After I left, we were **sued by York Research** for the return of our stock. The litigation dragged on for years, until the **summer of 1990**, when **Bob Benningson settled with me**. I sold all of my York Research stock through my broker for **\$3.3 million**. The other former stockholders continued the lawsuit and ultimately **won their case in 1991**.

It was **1985**, and I was out of a job again. But it didn’t take long—**Mike Parella** called and invited me to join his effort to take over and reconstitute **Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc.**, a public company based in **Miami**. At the time, the company needed to **secure its patent rights**, and Mike wanted my help to steer it forward. One of my first tasks was to fly to **Essex**, on the east side of **England**, to meet with **Professor Chaplin** at the **University of Essex**. The goal was to secure his **patent rights** related to controlling systematic noise using **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** technology. When I arrived at the **University of Essex**, I was met by people who were not happy—they had not been treated well by the previous managers of NCTI. I smoothed things over and closed the deal, ultimately paying **£100,000 British pounds** for the **PAC rights**. When I returned from England, I contacted **Eldon Ziegler** and asked him to go to **Miami** to evaluate what the team there actually had. His report was blunt — he advised that we **fire everyone** and **sell off everything** in Miami, as it was of little use. I hired Eldon as **VP of Engineering**, and he established a new **engineering lab in Columbia, Maryland**, leased space, and began building a new team. Meanwhile, I set up new offices in **Great Neck, New York**, and hired about a dozen staff to restart operations properly.

A few months later, **John McCloy Jr.** joined the company and began working closely with me. Each week, part of my routine was flying down to **Baltimore** to spend two days with **Eldon** and the engineering team, then returning to **New York**. John McCloy Jr. was the son of **John J. McCloy**, former U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, a major figure in 20th-century diplomacy who is widely regarded as the most influential private citizen of his era. He also played a key role in negotiating the settlement of the **Cuban Missile Crisis**. I even visited his father at his home in **Greenwich**, where we had a thoughtful and memorable conversation — he was **92 years old** at the time. John introduced me to many of his high-level contacts, including the **Secretary of Defense**, whom we met with in the **Pentagon**. Techland went on to sell some systems to the **U.S. military**. I also traveled to **Europe** with John, including visits to **Berlin** and **Munich**. In Berlin, John was treated like the president of the country—such was the respect accorded to him because of his father's legacy. During that visit, I had **house seats** to attend the final concert conducted by **Herbert von Karajan** and the **Berlin Symphony**, where they performed **Beethoven's Ninth Symphony**. During that same trip to Berlin, one of John's friends invited me to cross over to the other side of the **Berlin Wall**. I accepted, and we spent the day walking around **East Berlin**. It was an eerie experience — a stark contrast to the West — and one that stayed with me. In **1989**, I was asked to fly to **Seattle** to help one of NCTI’s salesmen close a deal with **Boeing**. I remember the trip vividly. The flight was scheduled to leave at **9 PM**, giving me time to sleep and arrive fresh. But it was **delayed repeatedly** and didn’t depart until **3 AM**. When I finally boarded, I found myself in the **middle seat of a row of five**, flanked by **two nuns on each side**. Needless to say, I arrived in Seattle with very little sleep — but still managed to perform admirably and **successfully closed the Boeing deal**.

After that, I began winding down my involvement with the company. In the **summer of 1990**, following the sale of my York Research stock, I **stopped working actively for Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc.**

* President of **Techland Systems Inc.** until 1985
* Focused on **protocol conversion systems**

  * Hardware and firmware to bridge incompatible systems
* Enabled:

  * PCs ↔️ Minicomputers ↔️ Mainframes
