## My Beginning in Computers

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

- At **16**, I started college as a **Computer Science major** at **Queens College**.
- The school had only a **Xerox-built mainframe**, and all programming was in **Fortran** via **punch cards**.
- You’d type each line onto a punch card, submit a stack, and wait **a week** for results—often discovering only a syntax error.
- Frustrated by this process and poor instruction, I left the major—but not my passion for computing.

### My DIY Hardware Evolution

- Built advanced **Heathkits**, ending with a **digital FM receiver**.
- Ordered one of the first **HP-85** calculators—waited **three months** for delivery.
- Used it in place of a slide rule during physics courses.

### Enter the Altair

- Bought an **audio sweep generator kit** from **MITS** in 1973 to align tape heads on my **TEAC** reel-to-reel.
- MITS sent me a **$100 discount certificate** in 1974.
- When the **Altair 8800** was introduced in *Popular Electronics*, I ordered one immediately—in kit form.
- Built it myself: it had just **256 bytes of memory** and blinking LEDs.

### BASIC Changed Everything

- Upgraded to **4 KB of RAM** and received **Microsoft BASIC on paper tape**.
- For the first time, I could **write code and get instant results**.
- This was a revelation after the week-long delays in college labs.

### Building Real Software

- Bought an **IMSAI Z-80 system** and wrote a full **invoicing, packing list, and A/R system** in BASIC for my father’s business.
- Stored everything on **cassette tape**—no floppy disks yet.
- Ran **CP/M**, and bought software from **Lifeboat Associates**.

> That Altair wasn’t just my first PC.  
> It was the gateway to a career in tech.

## Working at Lifeboat Associates

- In **1979**, **Tony Gold** (President of Lifeboat) called and offered me a job.
- In **1980**, I left my family’s plumbing supply business and joined **Lifeboat Associates**.

### Key Contributions:

- Edited and published **Lifelines**, our customer newsletter.
  - I openly documented **bugs in major software** — sparking strong reactions, including from **Bill Gates**.
- Negotiated **royalty contracts** with prominent developers.

### Industry Collaboration:

- **Micro Focus** – COBOL compilers
- **Peter Rozen** – TMaker
- **Balcones Software** (Austin, TX) – advanced accounting
  - Traveled there frequently

### Ford & Microsoft

- Helped **Ford Motor Company** develop its **early PC strategy**.
  - Presented at the **Renaissance Center** in Detroit.
- After an Intel conference in Oregon, **Bill Gates** gave **Neil Colvin** and me a personal tour of **Microsoft’s first Redmond campus**.
  - They had only leased **half** the building at the time!

### Behind the Scenes with Bill Gates

- Discussed his mission to stop **software piracy**.
  - His idea: **OEM bundling** — software pre-installed on computers.
- This approach led to deals with **Tandy**, among others.
- Ironically, it also laid the foundation for Microsoft’s **antitrust troubles**.

### BIOS Opportunity

- Had a close partnership with **Neil Colvin** (Phoenix Technologies).
- Tested **P-Mate** for **Mike Aaronson**, Neil’s friend.
- I was the one who suggested the market need for **third-party BIOS**—vital to launching the **IBM PC clone industry**.

> I didn’t get a commission—but I helped launch an industry.
